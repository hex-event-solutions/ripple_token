# Ripple Token

![Lint and test](https://github.com/hex-event-solutions/ripple_token/workflows/Lint%20and%20test/badge.svg)

Validates supplied JWT tokens against Keycloak's public key

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ripple_token'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ripple_token

## Usage

The client must be configured before usage

```ruby
RippleKeycloak::Client.configure do |c|
  c.base_url = <keycloak_url>
  c.realm = <keycloak_realm>
  c.client_id = <client_id>
  c.client_secret = <client_secret>
end
```

The supplied client must be of 'confidential' type, and allow service account login.

After configuring, use the supplied interfaces to query, create, update or delete resources in Keycloak.
